Indego Bike Share Go Library
==============================

About
-----

I know absolutely nothing about golang, but I'm playing with the idea of making a re-usable Go library for the Philadelphia Indego Bike Share API.

I'm going to attempt to make this similar to  [my existing Indego Python3 library](https://github.com/ericoc/indego-py-lib).
